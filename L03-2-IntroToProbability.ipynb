In other words, there is an equal probability that any face of each dice will land pointing up. In terms of probability, we say that the distribution of scores for each dice follows a **Uniform Distribution**. further, we assume that the dice are identical and that the score for each dice is not dependent on the other dice. In the terminology of probability, we can now say that the score of each dice is **Independent Identically Distributed**, or **iid**.  \n",

    "The long running television game show, *Let's Make A Deal*, created and hosted by *Monty Hall*, had its heyday in the 1970s. At the finale of a show, Monty would tell the winning contestant that she could pick a one of three doors. Behind one door there would be a valuable prize, like a car. Worthless items, like a goat, were placed behind the other two doors. The contestant would pick a door. At this point Monty would build suspense by opening one of the other doors. Monty knew which door had the valuable prize, and would always reveal one of the worthless prizes. He would then tell the contestant that they could change their choice of doors. The question then is, should the contestant switch or stick with their original choice? The figure below illustrates the situation the contestant faces if they pick Door 1:\n",
